<!-- ====== Self Summary ====== -->
**Self Summary**  
I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My work spans NLP, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science, with experience across LLM reasoning, retrieval, and applied modeling in industry (ads recommendation, logistics analytics, anomaly detection). I aim to build practical and explainable systems that are efficient and robust.

<!-- ====== Research Interests ====== -->
**Research Interests**  
Natural Language Processing (LLMs & reasoning), Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Data Science, Information Retrieval, Domain Adaptation, Low-resource NLP, Code-switched Machine Translation.
