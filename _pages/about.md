## Ongoing Research <a id="ongoing"></a>
<em>More projects on the <a href="/research-experience/">Research Experience</a> page.</em>

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Transfer (JHU)** *(2025–Present)*  
Transferring the reasoning capability of strong LLMs to weaker models to accurately reproduce multi-step reasoning under limited compute. Techniques include prompt design, reasoning pattern extraction, and knowledge-distillation-style training.
