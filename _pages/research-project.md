## ðŸ§ª Research  

### Evidential Support Analysis in Wikipedia Biography Articles (Mar. 2025 â€“ May. 2025)  
**Role:** Research Assistant Â· *Advised by Prof. Benjamin Van Durme*  
Created a benchmark of ~150K annotated claims from 1,485 Wikipedia articles to evaluate evidential support. Conducted BM25 and `trec_eval` evaluations across body-to-lead and source-to-body retrieval tasks. Extended framework with three dense retrievers (Inf-Retriever, NV-Embed, Ling-AI).  
Co-authored paper on [arXiv:2506.12637](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12637).  
**Johns Hopkins University Â· Baltimore, MD**

### AstroPath Cell Structure Segmentation (Mar. 2025 â€“ Aug. 2025)  
**Role:** Research Contributor Â· *Advised by Prof. Alex Szalay & Prof. Janis Taube*  
Supported application of UNSEG and CelloType models for region-level cell segmentation (e.g., cell wall, nucleus). Performed evaluation using DeepCell metrics as part of the AstroPath initiative.  
**Johns Hopkins University Â· Baltimore, MD**

### Robust Active Learning under Distribution Shift (May. 2025 â€“ Jul. 2025)  
**Role:** Research Contributor Â· *Advised by Prof. Anqi Liu*  
Explored baseline strategies for active learning under distribution shift, including G-optimal design, shift-pessimistic querying, and density-ratio-based uncertainty calibration. Contributed to implementation validation and pipeline integrity checks.  
**Johns Hopkins University Â· Baltimore, MD**

### Label-Free Single-Cell Morphology and Signal Analysis (Jan. 2023 â€“ Apr. 2023)  
Proposed a U-Net-based segmentation model to extract cell morphology without labeling. Integrated DeepCell-based signal tracking for quantitative analysis.  
Published at *2023 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications*.  
**University of Minnesota Â· Twin Cities, MN**

### Project Schedule Optimization via HRRN (Dec. 2022 â€“ Feb. 2023)  
Developed a multi-objective MIP framework with HRRN-based dynamic prioritization for complex project scheduling under uncertainty.  
Published at *2023 International Conference on Electronics and Devices, Computational Science*.  
**University of Minnesota Â· Twin Cities, MN**
