Single-cell morphology and dynamic signal analysis are essential to reveal cell biological mechanisms and discover new phenotypes.  
This paper proposes a single-cell morphology and dynamic signal analysis algorithm based on U-Net and DeepCell to improve segmentation, feature extraction, and signal-tracking of cells.
