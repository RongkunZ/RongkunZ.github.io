This work introduces **PeopleProfiles**, a large-scale dataset of claim support annotations on Wikipedia biographies.  
It analyzes the extent to which Wikipedia claims are grounded in article body evidence and cited sources, finding that a significant portion of claims remain unsupported.  
The study highlights challenges for evidence retrieval and emphasizes the importance of structured grounding resources for reliable NLP systems.
