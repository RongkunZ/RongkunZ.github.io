This paper proposes a project schedule optimization method based on an HRRN to solve scheduling problems under constraints.  
We design a multi-objective mixed integer programming model, introduce Monte Carloâ€“based risk adjustments, and construct a response ratio model to balance urgency and importance of tasks.
